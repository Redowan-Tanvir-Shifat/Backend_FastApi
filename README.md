# Introduction to Django

## What is Django?
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and comes with built-in tools and features to simplify web development.

## Pros and Cons of Django

### **Pros**
1. **Full-Featured Framework**
   - Includes ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), authentication, admin panel, templating, and more.
2. **Highly Secure**
   - Protects against common vulnerabilities like CSRF, XSS, etc.
3. **Rich Ecosystem**
   - A vast library of third-party packages for extended functionality.
4. **Community Support**
   - A large and active developer community.
5. **Batteries-Included Philosophy**
   - Built-in tools for common web development tasks.

### **Cons**
1. **Monolithic**
   - The all-in-one approach can be overkill for small or simple projects.
2. **Learning Curve**
   - Beginners may find it challenging to understand the full stack initially.
3. **Performance**
   - Slightly slower than microframeworks like Flask for lightweight applications.
